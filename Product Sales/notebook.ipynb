{"cells":[{"source":"# **DATA VALIDATION**\nThe Pens and Printers’ dataset contained 15000 rows and 8 columns prior to cleaning and validation.\nHaving validated and cleaned all the columns against all the information in the table, the following results were obtained:\n\n**- week:** This column has 6 unique values(1-6) counted as weeks since the new product line was launched. Null values were not present, therefore, cleaning of this column was not necessary.\n\n**- sales_method:** This column has 5 unique categories of sales method instead of 3 as highlighted in the information regarding the dataset.  The column was cleaned by replacing ‘email’ with ‘Email’ and ‘em + call’ with ‘Email + Call’. Having cleaned this column, 3 unique categories of sales method; ‘Call’, ‘Email’ and ‘Email + Call’ were obtained. Null values were not present.\n\n**- customer_id:** This column represents the unique identity of each customer. Cleaning of this column was not necessary as null values were not present. \n\n**- nb_sold:** This column represents the number of new products sold in the range of 7-16. Cleaning of this column was not necessary either as null values were not present.\n\n**- revenue:** This column represents the revenue from sales rounded to 2 decimal places. It had 1074 missing values. Since the missing values in this column were more than 5% of the data, it was considered a significant number of missing data. Missing values were therefore filled with the overall median revenue.\n\n**- years_as_customers:** This column represents the years of patronage by the customer. It is expected to be within the range of  0-40 years since the company was founded in the year 1984. However, this column produced 2 outliers (47 and 63). The rows containing the outliers were dropped.\n\n**- nb_site_visits:** This column represents the number of times the customer visited the website in the last 6 months. Cleaning of this column was not necessary as null values were not present.\n\n**- state:** This column contains 50 categories of locations where the products were shipped. No null values were present in this column; therefore, cleaning was not necessary.\n\nHaving done data validation and cleaning on the Pens and Printers’ 6 weeks dataset, a total of 14998 rows and 8 columns without missing values were obtained and this validated and cleaned dataset was used for further analysis.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c40cc931-e200-4bc8-b474-91c35e7994de"},{"source":"# **How many customers were there for each approach?**\n\nFrom the Pens and Printers’ 6 weeks dataset that consisted of 14998 validated and cleaned entries, a total of 7465 customers, about 50% of the total customers were contacted through the ‘Email’ sales method.\nA total of 4961 customers; 33% of the total customers  were contacted through the ‘Call’ sales method while a total of 2572; 17%  of the total customers were contacted through the ‘Email + Call’ sales method which produced the least customer engagement.\n\n![Customers by Sales Approach](bar_chart.JPG)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e076fbbb-7c60-4871-9e50-484e2ee4dee0"},{"source":"# **What does the spread of the revenue look like overall?

The ‘Email’ sales method produced an average revenue above 75 in week 1  which however increased in a slight crest and trough approach to above 100 in week 5 and with a steady increase to above 125 in week 6.

Furthermore, this sales method requires little work from the sales team, it is also cost effective and saves time as the sales team only need to be on the phone with a customer for 10 minutes.\nIf there is a need to consider a secondary sales method, I would recommend that the ‘Email’ method be considered as it produced quite an encouraging revenue too and also cost effective and with better time management.\nHowever, the  ‘Call’ sales method should be discontinued due to low revenue generation, high cost and time requirements.\n\n![Average Revenue for Each Method](bar_chart_2.JPG)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e55a8fca-ff48-4aae-ada6-cf973ca550a2"},{"source":"# **Differences Between Customers**\nFrom the histogram below, insights with regards to the distribution of customers patronizing the company can be seen.

From the ‘Email + Call’ sales method within the 6 weeks period, the average revenue generated was 170.88. This could be used as a metric to measure an increase in sales as an increase in average revenue above this value indicates business growth while the opposite becomes the case in the case of  a decrease in average revenue below this value and therefore the need for improvement.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e421e888-1d4c-450b-bbb7-a55d6b39d0e0"},{"source":"# **RECOMMENDATIONS**\nIn a nutshell and with the results of the analysis, I would recommend that Pens and Printers as a company, focuses on the followings:\n- Employ business metric as described above as a measure to monitor business growth.\n- Employ ‘Email + Call’ sales method as it is more cost effective, generates higher revenue, requires little effort from the sales team and with better time management.\n- The company should consider discontinuing the ‘Call’ sales method as it is not cost effective, requires more work from the sales team and generates little revenue, and this is not good for business.\n- Improvement of data collection process so as to prevent missing values and error in data collection which could result in error in computation.\n- Provide data with regards to the type of products purchased by customers in order to have an idea of their purchasing sense and habit as this would help direct more focus on improving sales of products not frequently purchased by customers.\n- Devise strategies to improve customers retention as this is paramount for every business growth, perhaps through sales promotion because from the analysis, customers that have been with the company 25 years and above appeared to have made the lowest purchases.\n- Pens and Printers should prioritize products with higher purchases rates while still working on improving the purchasing rates of others.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9d3e6335-01a7-4d44-9a6b-3fc370b49492"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
